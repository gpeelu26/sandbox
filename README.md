# 🏖️ Sandbox

Welcome to the **Sandbox** – our playground for experiments, brainstorming, and random thoughts for the graduation project.  

This repository is not for production-ready code. Instead, it’s a space where we can:  

- 📝 Drop quick notes and ideas  
- 🎨 Share sketches, diagrams, and doodles  
- ⚡ Try out small code experiments or prototypes  
- 🔍 Explore "what if" scenarios without rules  
- 💡 Collect references, links, and inspiration  

Think of it as our digital playground where everything starts before becoming serious.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

1. Add your idea, experiment, or note in the right folder.  
2. Don’t overthink formatting — raw ideas are welcome here.  
3. If you’re trying out code, put it in `prototypes/` with a short README.  

> 🏖️ Remember: **This is a sandbox. Play, break, build, repeat.**

## 🎯 Goal

The goal of this repo is to **capture creativity and encourage experimentation**.  
It’s a safe space to throw around ideas, test concepts, and document thoughts without worrying about polish.  

Later, the best ideas will graduate from the sandbox into dedicated repositories (monitoring, predictive models, digital twin, etc.).
